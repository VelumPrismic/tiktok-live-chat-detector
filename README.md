<!-- Start of Guidelines -->
Guidelines for editing code:
- Don't add any comments to the code.
- Always tell me what files you've edited after editing the code in a neat list.
- Do not add comments and do not remove any pre existing code.
- If the file is too big, edit the file in small parts so you don't mess up the whole file.
- Create the least amount of files possible.
- ALWAYS uphold the 'do not repeat yourself' coding principle.
- Let's use Django to work on the UI.
